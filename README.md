# First Game - Pygame Platformer

Welcome to **First Game**, a simple platformer game built using the Pygame library in Python. This game features a player character that can move left, right, and jump, as well as shoot projectiles at an enemy. The goal is to defeat the enemy while avoiding collisions to maintain your score.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Move left, right, and jump using the arrow keys.
- **Shooting**: Shoot projectiles using the spacebar.
- **Enemy AI**: An enemy that patrols back and forth and can be defeated by shooting it.
- **Score System**: Gain points by hitting the enemy and lose points if the player collides with the enemy.
- **Animations**: Walking and standing animations for both the player and the enemy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Pygame**: You can install Pygame using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Download the Game Files**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

4. **Run the Game**: Navigate to the directory containing the game files and run the script:

   python first_game.py
   ```

## Controls

- **Left Arrow Key**: Move the player to the left.

## Gameplay

- The player starts at a specific position on the screen.
